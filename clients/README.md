# gRPC Clients

This directory contains client implementations for consumers of the gRPC service.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates how different languages can consume the same shared gRPC definitions. Each client implements the same set of operations defined in the protos.

## Available Clients

- **[Java](./java)**: A Java + Spring Boot based client.
- **[Node.js](./node)**: A Node.js client using `@grpc/grpc-js`.

Please refer to the README in each subdirectory for specific usage, configuration, and build instructions.
